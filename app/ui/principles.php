<p>Experience design principles are intended to help and guide us in all of our design work and also help us assess and evaluate it. These principles should have longevity beyond a single project or initiative!</p>
<p>Design principles underpin everything we do for our digital customer experience, and inform the way our products
  <strong>behave, how they look, and the way we operate as a team</strong>.</p>
<p>Learn and embrace these principles, apply them religiously and lean on them as needed. They are a representation of everything
  <strong>you</strong>, the people of PageUp want our
  <strong>experience</strong>
  to be.</p>

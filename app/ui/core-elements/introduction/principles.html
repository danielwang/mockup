        <p>There are many sources of data about our customers which help us understand their needs, issues and wants during the initial design process. Some of this is easy to get access to and some is harder, but we should always investigate what we can get
          hold of in our time frames. This could be survey data, customer service data, usage or account data.</p>

        <p>Talking to customers helps us understand the not only what is important for our customers but also build empathy with them. Empathy helps us make the right decisions and come up with new ideas to make our customer’s lives better and PageUp their
          first choice.</p>
        <p>Our customers have needs that can be quite specialist, so it is important to make sure we are identifying our target audience and talking to them. There is little point talking to one set of people if it’s actually different set of people you are
          designing for.</p>

        <p>Accessibility is not only about making designs accessible for people with profound disabilities, it is about making it accessible to the 10–20% of who have dif culty accessing technology.</p>
        <p>Difficulty accessing technology can be due to technical limitations such as slow connection speeds. Our designs should cater for this and gracefully degrade.</p>

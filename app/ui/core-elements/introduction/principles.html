<h2>About the principles</h2>
<p>These
  <strong>experience design principles</strong>
  are intended to help and guide us in all of our design work and also help us assess and evaluate it. These principles should have
  <strong>longevity</strong>
  beyond a single project or initiative!</p>
<p>They underpin everything we do for our digital customer experience, and inform the way our products
  <strong>behave, how they look, and the way we operate as a team</strong>.</p>
<p>Learn and embrace these principles, apply them religiously and lean on them as needed. They are a representation of everything
  <strong>you</strong>, the people of PageUp want our
  <strong>experience</strong>
  to be.</p>

  Listen to the data</h3>
<p>There are many sources of data about our customers which help us understand their needs, issues and wants during the initial design process. Some of this is easy to get access to and some is harder, but we should always investigate what we can get
  hold of in our time frames. This could be survey data, customer service data, usage or account data.</p>
<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  Talk to real users</h3>
<p>Talking to customers helps us understand the not only what is important for our customers but also build empathy with them. Empathy helps us make the right decisions and come up with new ideas to make our customer’s lives better and PageUp their
  first choice.</p>
<p>Our customers have needs that can be quite specialist, so it is important to make sure we are identifying our target audience and talking to them. There is little point talking to one set of people if it’s actually different set of people you are
  designing for.</p>
<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  Make it accessible</h3>
<p>Accessibility is not only about making designs accessible for people with profound disabilities, it is about making it accessible to the 10–20% of who have dif culty accessing technology.</p>
<p>Difficulty accessing technology can be due to technical limitations such as slow connection speeds. Our designs should cater for this and gracefully degrade.</p>

<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  Create the entire experience</h3>
<p>To understand the experience we need to look from the customer’s point of view. What are they trying to achieve and what is the journey to achieve this. Make sure you understand the entire ow and the overall effect of the experience you are trying
  to create.
</p>

<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>&nbsp;Making it personal</h3>
<p>We put the customer at the center of the experience. Creating value by delivering relevant and contextual solutions at the right time and on the right device.</p>
<p>Remember the customer, their preferences, what they did, what they liked and didn’t like to personalise the experience. Expose previous choices rather than asking customers to make the same selections again and again.
</p>

<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  No&nbsp;instructions necessary</h3>
<p>It’s easy to use and makes talent management simple. It serves customer, employee and talent needs. It’s elegant and intuitive.</p>
<p>Make the key paths and elements most obvious. Provide information to support tasks; minimise the need to remember. Make the current situation, what can be done and what has been done, clear. Allow customers to try things without risk.
</p>

<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  Be consistent , not uniform</h3>
<p>Increase trust by being familiar and recognisably PageUp. Use the same language and the same design patterns to help customers get familiar with our products. Even when this isn’t possible, employ a consistent approach so that customers can
  anticipate what they are supposed to do.
</p>

<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  Leading the way</h3>
<p>PageUp&nbsp;delivers on its promise to make talent management simple, uncomplicated and people shaped. It should lead users through the process with as little friction as possible.</p>
<p>Reduce your design to its essence. Decide what is the main purpose of this product, this feature, and this screen. Leave only the most relevant elements on screen so customers can be immersed in the experience.
</p>
<h3>
  <i class="gel-icon-logo"></i>
  Creating irrational loyalty</h3>
<p>Customers are delighted when they interact with us. We help them succeed and make them smile. Make a great experience memorable by adding personality, surprise, beauty and fun.</p>
<p>Make the experience universal and functional but include unobtrusive surface delighter’s. Design for deeper delight that is more about the customer and less about the product.</p>

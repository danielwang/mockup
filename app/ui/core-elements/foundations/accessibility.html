PERCEIVABLE

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive (e.g. alt tags that say what the item actually does, like ‘Submit form Button’).

OPERABLE

User interface components and navigation must be operable (e.g., you must be able to navigate the site using a keyboard as well as a mouse).

UNDERSTANDABLE

Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable, (e.g. error messaging on a form should make sense; instead of ‘Invalid field’ messaging, use ‘The Email field must be in a valid format’).

ROBUST

Content must be robust enough so it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. In other words, don’t use tags or code that only certain browsers understand.
